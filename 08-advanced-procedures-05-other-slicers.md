### Third Party Slicers
A slicer is what you use to turn a 3D model ([STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29) file) into a Gcode file, this is what defines how the 3D Printer moves, amount of material to push out, speed, temperature, etc. If you're curious what all those Gcode values do, there’s an [online wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) that describes them all.

For the Settings, please read the provided Forum Threads as they have helpful tips and solutions that people have come up with for that respective slicer. Plus those threads are also a great place to ask questions and share your own modifications.

#### Simplify 3D (S3D)
<https://www.simplify3d.com/> <br/>
Considered to be the best of the best when it comes to slicers. But it also comes with a steep price tag of **$150**. So if you are planning on making money from 3D Printing, it might be worth the investment.

> ##### Tip: Configuration Assistant
> In the Help menu is a Configuration Assistant that will allow you get the most recent profile for the Trinus 3D Printer, it’s currently listed as “Kodama Trinus”. Currently (as of the writing of this guide) there is a bug in this profile that prevents you from printing via SD Card. A user in the forums had posted a very simple fix for this:

#### Cura
<https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software> <br/>
This is an excellent free option with a ton of features, and is a great starting point if you want to venture out into the world of 3rd Party Slicers.

> ##### NOTE
> Currently it doesn’t seem possible to use Cura to connect to your printer over USB in Windows / Mac; users have had success with Linux though. So if you need a way to print via USB then I’d suggest one of the Other Slicers such as Repetier (<https://www.repetier.com/>) or even OctoPrint for printing over WiFi.

#### Other Slicers
Here’s a quick list of other slicers, but I haven’t seen anyone mention settings to be used with them. Will update this document with Forum links if I come across them, or someone recommends them. You can try using the same settings from Cura / S3D as a starting point for these as well.

**Slic3r** - <http://slic3r.org/> <br/>
**Repetier** - <https://www.repetier.com/> <br/>
**CraftWare** - <https://craftunique.com/craftware> <br/>

There are plenty of [other options for slicing](https://all3dp.com/best-3d-slicer-software-3d-printer/), but these are the most popular ones that I’m aware of. If you feel another should be added to the list, and you have some settings for it, please add a comment in the [forums](http://www.kodamaforums.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1627).
